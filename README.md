## Regarding Internet Blackouts

It is fantastic that you want to exercise your right to protest.  If you want to **_really_** make a difference, please also consider the following:

1. [Call your US Senators and your US House Representative](http://cms.fightforthefuture.org/cispa/) and tell them that you oppose CISPA.
	> Hi, this is YOUR FULL NAME calling from YOUR TOWN. I'm calling today because I oppose CISPA, and I want Senator LASTNAME to vote against it.

2. Email EFF ([action@eff.org](mailto:action@eff.org)) and [contact the ACLU](http://www.aclu.org/general-feedback) and tell them that **you demand they go on the offensive by authoring legislation that explicitly protects our values for the internet.  We can't afford to be reactionary and defensive every time bad bills are proposed.  We need them to lobby aggressively for bills that protect the internet.**  After you contact them, donate to both organizations. 
3. Vote in every election (every two years).  Donate to good candidates with [good voting records](http://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/113-2013/h117).
